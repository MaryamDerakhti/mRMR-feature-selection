In this repository, we use the mRMR method, which is a feature selection method for dimensionality reduction, to select the necessary features to diagnose heart disease, and then perform the classification with SVM. The dataset used in this repository is The Cleveland Clinic
Heart Disease Dataset acquired from Kaggle, which consists of 14 features and 303 instances.
